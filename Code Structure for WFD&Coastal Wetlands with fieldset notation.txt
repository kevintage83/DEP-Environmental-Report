    j. Work for areas upland of the mean high water line in the area of CAFRA jurisdiction is regulated under CAFRA. Work in an upland of a MHWL outside of CAFRA area (i.e. on the Hudson River) work would require an waterfront IP-Upland.

    k. No one can apply for a waterfront coastal GP and a Waterfront IP for work on the same site. All work must be approved under the IP. They could apply for a CAFRA coastal GP and a Waterfront IP. I.E. CAFRA GP 9 to rebuild a house and a Waterfront Development
    In-Water IP.

    l. There are two different types of COASTAL GP's. The waterfront GP's are for work not requiring an IP taking place waterward of the MHWL. There are also Coastal GP's under CAFRA these are for work Upland of the MHWL in the CAFRA area or out of the CAFRA
    area. This is confusing mistake made when the types of GP's were being assigned in NJEMS. Until we create a new Class Code in NJEMS for coastal GP's we will have this confusion.

    m. Ensure waterway is actually a man made lagoon and NOT a man-altered waterway. This would kick the project into an IP and the GP unit doesn't always check. A natural waterway usually has water flowing through it. If the only flow is tide going up and
    down it is usually man made or man altered. Man altered like the Cape May canal needs IP's not GP's. In IMAP pull up the location of the property and using the tidelands layer you can check if the water body is claimed by tidelands then it is natural
    if unclaimed it is man made.

    n. If an applicant built a home before CAFRA II 1996 they can subdivide and apply for a GP8 to build a new home. If the home was built or rebuilt under a GP after CAFRA II the second home needs a CAFRA IP.
