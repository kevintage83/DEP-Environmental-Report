# NJDEP-Application-PreReview
A desktop application that guides an Environmental Specialist through the review process of any permit application at the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, Department of Land Use Regulation.
This application is designed to sit on the Environmental Specialist's desktop, and provide specific information needed to process any permit application they may receive. 
The application will obviate much of the training and oversight provided by Training Managers and Senior Permit Writers. 
The application will serve as a training aid for the uninitiated, and as a reference manual for those who are familiar with the permit writing process.
